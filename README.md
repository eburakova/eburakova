Hello there! I am Ekaterina (Katja), I am 30 y.o. and just got my Dr. rer. nat. title for a work in solid-state protein NMR spectroscopy. 
I got into coding in my master's and got fascinated with the room 

👩‍🎓 In my doctoral years, I focussed on the applicability and adaptation of existing routines relating protein geometry with the raw data (the sets of chemical shifts) for heterogeneous samples. Besides, I explored and proposed novel heterogeneity metrics. 
This was a largely interdisciplinary project that combined the domains of quantum physics, molecular biology as well as computer science and programming.

🌱 In my future career, I would like to continue developing my analytical skills and head towards data analysis and data science. I am currently exploring the realm of Natural Language Processing.
