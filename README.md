Hello there! I am Ekaterina (Katja), I am 30 y.o. and just got my Dr. rer. nat. title for a work in solid-state protein NMR spectroscopy. 

👩‍🎓 In my doctoral years, I focussed on feature engineering in protein structural biology. I adapted of existing models of structure - proterty relationship for a specific case of highly statically disordered samples. 
I explored and proposed scores for the *degree of local disorder*. 
This was a largely interdisciplinary project that combined the domains of quantum physics, molecular biology as well as data science.

🐠 Currently I am a part of a Data Science Bootcamp @ [neue fische](https://github.com/neuefische), where I polish my old skills and learn new ones.  

🌱 In my future career, I would like to apply methods of data science to solve problems in medical research, agriculture, or energetics.

📊 My main interests are EDA (Exploraive Data Analysis), feature engineering and (especially) vizualizations.
