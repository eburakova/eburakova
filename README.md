Hello there! I am Ekaterina (Katja), I am about 30 y.o. and just got my Dr. rer. nat. title for a work in solid-state protein NMR spectroscopy. 

👩‍🎓 In my doctoral years, I focussed on feature engineering in protein structural biology. I adapted of existing models of structure - proterty relationship for a specific case of highly statically disordered samples. 
I explored and proposed scores for the *degree of local disorder*. 
This was a largely interdisciplinary project that combined the domains of quantum physics, molecular biology as well as data science.

🐠 In spring 2024, I graduated from the Data Science Bootcamp @ [neue fische](https://github.com/neuefische), where I practiced my old skills and learn plently of new ones. 

🧑‍🔬 Since 2024, I am working with Czech biotech startup [AI|ffinity](https://www.aiffinity.com/) as a freelance scientific consultant, data analyst, and a software developer.

🌱 In my future career, I would like to apply methods of data science to solve problems in life sciences or engineering.

## Data science
- 🏎️ [`d-drivers`](https://github.com/eburakova/d-drivers) - **Data-driven search for traffic drivers**. This is the graduation project at the [neue fische](https://github.com/neuefische) Data science bootcamp (Apr 2024). Our team of five analyzed the internal content data of [EFAHRER.com](https://efahrer.chip.de/). We modelled the page impressions in the news feed and built a data app for the editorial managers.
- 🔥 [`fraud-detection`](https://github.com/eburakova/fraud-detection-energy) - Analyzing energy consumption patterns to detect which clients have meddled with the electrical and gas counters.
- 🏘️ [`eda-kc-housing`](https://github.com/eburakova/eda-kc-housing) - Analysis of price defining factors on the King County housing dataset for a mock client interested in investment into property development. EDA showcase prepared as a part of the DS bootcamp.
## NMR
- [`nmr_utils`](https://github.com/eburakova/nmr_utilities) - simple scripts for all things NMR (mostly, for proteins): handy tools for visualization and NUS data handling. 
- [`protein_heterogeneity_ssnmr`](https://github.com/eburakova/protein_heterogeneity_ssnmr) - the tools related to [the paper in J.Biomol.NMR 2022](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10858-019-00291-z)
## Side projects
- Handled big data to calculate my tax returns 2022-2024. Ask me about my personal tools for **accounting** and **real-time transaction analysis**. 
- [`geoname_matching`](https://github.com/eburakova/geoname_matching) - search engine for city names, tolerant to misspellings and outdated names.
